# AuroraOS
AuroraOS is an Open-Source Operating System developed by me with goal: develop a free, open source operating system (not just a kernel) that uses few resources and is the most fool proof possibile.
## Prerequisites
The prerequisites for compiling Aurora are:
  - Linux OS
  - GAS assembler
  - GCC
  - Xorriso
  - Grub-mkrescue
  - Qemu

If you do not have the necessary prerequisites you can install them by running the "Install.sh" file using the following command:
```bash
sh Install.sh
```
It only works on a debian distribution, if you don't have it you will have to install the packages manually.

## Build
To start the build of Aurora just start from the terminal the file "build.sh" with the following command:
```bash
sh build.sh
```
